## DLRC for Volkswagen
### SRC
We can use the *._camera_calibration.py* scripts to make sure that the camera is positioned correctly on the robot. Executing run.py starts the model initialization and launches the policy. The *shut_down.py* allows you to reset the robot to the inital postion tso that you do not need to recalibrate all the time. The src consists of the following parts:

#### *camera*
#### *color_cluster*
#### *fcn*
#### *mqtt_master*
#### *policy*
#### *tracking*
#### *vae_clustering*
